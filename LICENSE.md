# ThingBoot Device SDK (Flutter) — License and Terms of Use

Copyright (c) 2026 芯步（ThingBoot）科技有限公司 / ThingBoot Technology Co., Ltd.  
All rights reserved.

## 1. Definitions

- **"SDK"** means the Dart source code, example code, scripts, and documentation provided in this repository.
- **"Licensed Device"** means a single device whose application integrates the SDK and connects to the ThingBoot cloud platform.
- **"Licensee"** means the individual or entity downloading or using the SDK.
- **"Platform Access Service"** means the cloud-based device management, messaging, OTA, and other services provided by ThingBoot.

## 2. SDK Grant of License

ThingBoot grants Licensee a **non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable, royalty-free license** to:

- Download and use the SDK for software development.
- Integrate the SDK into applications for devices that connect to the ThingBoot platform.
- Distribute application binaries that incorporate the SDK to end users.

The SDK itself is **free of charge**. There is no per-developer fee, no per-build fee, and no upfront license fee for using the SDK.

## 3. Platform Access Fee

The SDK itself is **free of charge**. Platform access is billed as follows:

- **Free quota**: each developer account receives **100 free device connections per year**, intended to cover the prototyping volume of a development team. Devices must be registered and activated on the ThingBoot platform.
- **Open Platform API**: managing and controlling devices via the ThingBoot Open Platform API is metered and billed separately. This part mainly serves end customers; developers typically do not need it.
- **Production stage**: when a product enters mass production, the factory (manufacturer) is charged a platform access fee per connected device, plus optional Open Platform API usage fees.

- Devices beyond the free quota or without a valid factory subscription may be refused connection or remotely disabled by the platform.
- Devices used in purely offline / LAN-only mode are not subject to the cloud Platform Access Service fee.

## 4. Restrictions

Licensee **shall not**:

- Redistribute, sublicense, sell, lease, or transfer the SDK (in whole or in part) to any third party as a standalone library or development kit.
- Remove or alter any proprietary notices, copyright notices, or labels on the SDK.
- Use the SDK to develop competing IoT platforms, device-management clouds, or SDK products that replicate the core functions of the ThingBoot platform or SDK.
- Use the SDK in violation of any applicable law or regulation.

## 5. Ownership

The SDK and all intellectual property rights therein are and shall remain the exclusive property of ThingBoot. This Agreement does not convey any ownership interest.

## 6. Termination

ThingBoot may terminate this Agreement immediately if Licensee breaches any term. Upon termination, Licensee must cease all use of the SDK and destroy all copies.

## 7. Disclaimer & Limitation of Liability

THE SDK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THINGBOOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE OF THE SDK.

## 8. Governing Law

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the People's Republic of China.

## 9. Third-Party Software Notice

This SDK is built for Flutter / Dart and depends on third-party open-source packages. The proprietary license terms above apply **only to ThingBoot's own SDK code** (the Dart sources, examples, and scripts created by ThingBoot).

Third-party dependencies — including but not limited to `mqtt_client`, `crypto`, `http`, and `shared_preferences` — are governed by their own open-source licenses (MIT, BSD, Apache-2.0, etc.). These licenses are independent of the commercial terms above, and are declared in `pubspec.yaml` / `pubspec.lock`. Licensee is responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable third-party licenses in the final application.

ThingBoot does not claim that the entire SDK or any third-party component is released under the same proprietary terms. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as modifying or overriding the license terms of any third-party open-source software.
